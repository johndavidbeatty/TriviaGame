Basic Trivia Game demonstrating timers

Had basic requirements.
-questions data was portable so first element in array would provide title and could be changed.
-any number of questions would be used.
-questions could have any number of answers
-Double clicks wouldn't be counted
-There are graphics at the bottom, this looked fine on my big monitor but you may need to scroll down for a laptop.
-If I had more time I would have added a responsivenes component.
-Thanks
